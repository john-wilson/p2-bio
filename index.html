<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I love Design. Many people see it as a chore or something that has to be done, but to me it is what I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I am originally from Southern California, the land of golden beaches and the greatest place on Earth. The memories I have from SoCal often influence my design, and I love palm trees, sun, and the waves. When I&#39;m not designing, I enjoy video games, longboarding, and hanging with friends making new memories. </p>
